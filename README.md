# Photo-Inspo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

Before you follow the steps below, go to the [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) website and register an account if
you don't have one. We need an API key from Pexels, and it is free!

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
2. In your terminal, we need to assign the pexels API key to an environment variable, like so: <br>
   `export REACT_APP_PEXEL_ID=<YOUR_PEXEL_API_KEY>`<br>
   In the above, you will replace the `<YOUR_PEXEL_API_KEY>` with the one you got from the Pexels website.
3. Run `npm start` in that same terminal you set your environment variable.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
